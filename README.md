# typoteka

**Typoteka** takes its name from the fusion of *typography* and *bibliotheka* â€” the Greek word for library. It is a minimal yet powerful toolkit for crafting well-styled books and documents. Write your content in [**Markdown**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), convert it to clean HTML with [**Pandoc**](https://pandoc.org), apply custom CSS for layout and design, and render high-quality PDFs using [**paged.js**](https://pagedjs.org). **Typoteka** is aimed at writers, designers, and developers who want full control over the publishing process using open, modern technologies.
